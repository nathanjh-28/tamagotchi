## User Stories
 
 1.  Website that appears and functions like a [tamagotchi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi)

2.  Upon first glance, a brief greeting where the user will have the option to name their pet and select the color of their digital Tamagotchi device from an approved list of colors based on real [tamagotchis](https://tamagotchi.com/products/).  And hit submit. (They will keep the option to update this as they are playing).

3.   Their chosen name will appear listed inside the tamagotchi next to the age and their health  metrics exist below (happy, hungry, sleepy etc).  

4.   Appearance: Outside the window of the tamagotchi will be a colored 3d contoured console with the color of their choosing.  At the top will be the logo of Tamagochi (or as close as possible) based on the real device and on the bottom will be three buttons that will correspond to the metrics (feed them, play with them, turn off the lights).  The background for the digital pet will be a neutral gray and the tamagotchi itself will have a slight drop shadow for enhanced 3d effect.  

5. Interactivity:  The age of the pet will increase by one every minute, and the metrics will start at a random value between 0 and 5, and randomly increase over time.  The way to decrease the metrics will be to push the buttons.  When you push the corresponding button the metric will  decrease by one.  An animation will occur when you push the button.  When you push the sleep button the lights will go out of a few seconds as well.  

6.  Pet Appearance:  The pet will start out as a dinosaur egg.  As certain thresholds for the age are completed, the image of the pet will change to a more mature dinosaur.

7.  Losing the Game:  If any of the health metrics reach 10, the pet will die.  Their image will be replaced with a grave, all values for metric and age will be frozen, and nothing will happen when you push the buttons.  

8.  Winning the Game: If the pet reaches the age of 20, the game will freeze and inform you that you won via alert and/or animation.
