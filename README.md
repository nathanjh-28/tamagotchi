User Story Draft 1.0

- Website that appears and functions like a tamagotchi.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi

- Upon first glance, the user will have the option to name their pet and select the color of their digital Tamagachi device from an approved list of colors based on real tamagochis.

- An egg will appear inside the simulated Tamagochi with their name and age listed above, and their health metrics below (happy, hungry, sleepy etc).  

- Outside the window of the tamagachi will be a colored 3d contoured console with the color of their choosing.  At the top will be the logo of Tamagochi based on the real device and on the bottom will be three buttons that will correspond to the metrics (feed them, play with them, turn off the lights).  The background will be a neutral gray and the tamagochi will have a slight drop shadow.  

- Interactivity:  The age of the pet will increase over time (units for age?), and the metrics will start at 10 and slowly decrease over time.  The way to increase the metrics will be to push the buttons.  When you push the feed button and play button there will be some kind of animation for the pet.  When you push the sleep button, the website will go in to dark mode for the pet to sleep with some Zs floating above them.  

- Pet Appearance:  The pet will start out as a dinosaur egg.  Every (X of units of age) the image of the pet will change.  The pet will look like a baby dinosaur with egg shells sticking to them.  As they get older they lose the shell and grow in to an adolescent dinosaur, teenage dinosaur, and finally an adult dinosaur.
